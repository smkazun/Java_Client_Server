This java project needs to be unzipped and be used in Eclipse.
Once the .java files are available to be ran and compiled in the Elcipse IDE
simply start running the Server.java file first and then run Client.java. Client.java
can be ran multiple times, which will create multiple threads for you to input a name on each console window.
